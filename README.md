  <summary><b>Additional Information (To Keep Symmetry)</b></summary>
  <br />
 <p>I'm 17 y/o and I'm in 2nd grade of High-school, self-tought programmer since 2021 (I was 13 y/o). I'm currently interesed on learning C++, to create an app made with GTK libs, to make it cross-platforms and more reliable on Linux/BSD systems. Also I have in mind do a protocol with ssh-key validation and a lock file to make a private social media, reproducible to make it self-hosted.</p>
 <p>In my system I'm using Void Linux, with glibc as standard lib, and Nix to create development environments. However, I have been using more distributions before, like Fedora-based distros, Arch-based, Debian-based, NixOS and this one.</p>
 <p>I started to code with NodeJS runtime, and the last project with it was a LSP to deploy a presence to Discord, that is hosted by <a href="https://github.com/doupkg">@doupkg</a> org, which I'm part of it. Also I'm member of <a href="https://github.com/nosesisaid">@nosesisaid</a>, which is the organization that have the project I mentioned first, an app with GTK.</p>
 <p>Far from coding, studying how GNU/Linux works, attending my academic course, doing physical sports, I like to study ways of thinking. I wouldn't say philosophy, because I consider that its term is ambiguous in this present time, due to the fact that people designate old ways of thinking, alien to our time, culture and media, as a virtue, when it is not so. We don't make decisions, decisions make us.</p>
